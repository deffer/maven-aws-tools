= AWS tools maven plugin

At the moment only supports upload of resources to S3 bucket.

== Usage

* Set up your preferred way of supplying AWS credentials
* Configure plugin in then pom
* Run `mvn aws-tools:upload`

For example, the minimal configuration below will upload file `background.jpg` into `castle-public` bucket. Credentials will bee looked in the `USER_HOME/.aws/credentials` file.

 <build>
 	<pluginManagement>
 		<plugins>
 			<plugin>
 				<groupId>org.deffer.maven</groupId>
 				<artifactId>aws-tools-maven-plugin</artifactId>
 				<version>1.1</version>
 				<extensions>true</extensions>
 				<configuration>
 					<source>background.jpg</source>
 					<bucketName>castle-public</bucketName>
 				</configuration>
 			</plugin>
 		</plugins>
 	</pluginManagement>
 </build>

To upload several files, use

 <configuration>
    <sources>
 	    <source>background.jpg</source>
 	    <source>tile.jpg</source>
    </sources>
 	<bucketName>castle-public</bucketName>
 </configuration>

== Limitations

Only one bucket can be configured per execution.

No metadata support. No ACL support.

When uploading  more than 1 file/folder, destination names of files will be the same as original names.
